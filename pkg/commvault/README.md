# Code generator

The api client code is generated by the OpenAPI3 spec located in this folder by swagger-codegen.
The following command is used:
```shell
java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate \
   -i "<path to repo>/terraform-provider-commvault/pkg/commvault/ApiExplorerOpenAPI3.yaml" \
   -l go \
   -o "<path to repo>/terraform-provider-commvault/pkg/commvault/apiclient" --additional-properties packageName=apiclient
```

Manual changes after generation:
- Rename the file `api_blackout_windows.go` -> `api_blackoutwindows.go`, since go do not build files with `windows.go` suffix unless we build on windows platform
- Changed content of `model_laptops_list.go` ->
  ```go
    package apiclient
    
    type LaptopsList struct {
	    LaptopsListWebConsole   []LaptopsWebConsole
	    LaptopsListAdminConsole []LaptopsAdminConsole
    }
    ```

## Local development

### Terraform provider

1. See description at (terraform own tutorial)[https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework/providers-plugin-framework-provider#prepare-terraform-for-local-provider-install]
   The key in `dev_overrides` block should be `statisticsnorway/commvaultx`, like:
   ```hcl
     dev_overrides {
         "statisticsnorway/commvaultx" = "<PATH>"
     }
   ```
2. Install the provider with with `go install .`
3. Navigate to the `examples` folder and run terraform as usual (`init` and `plan)

### Commvault API explorer

To run requests against the API using the API Explorer (or curl):

1. The Commvault Api Explorer is available over VPN on IP: https://193.160.175.103/webconsole/sandbox/apiexplorer . The
   admin GUI is also avaiable on path `/commandcenter`
2. Username and password are stored in the `org-secrets` GCP-project
3. Base64 encode the password.
4. Get access token by issuing a request to:
    ```shell
    curl -sk -X POST "https://193.160.175.103/commandcenter/api/Login" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "username": "<username in clear text>",
    "password": "<base64 encoded password>",
    "encodeBase64": true
    }'
    ```
5. Get the token, authorize and send requests

Terraform Provider for CommvaultX

The CommvaultX Terraform provider allows you to manage Commvault resources such as clients and, in the future, backup jobs, directly from Terraform.
This version is maintained by Statistics Norway and is not affiliated with the official Commvault provider.

⸻

Features
	•	Create and delete Commvault clients.
	•	Retrieve client information.
	•	(Planned) Manage backup jobs for Google Cloud Storage buckets.

⸻

Requirements
	•	Terraform >= 1.0
	•	Go >= 1.21 (for building from source)
	•	Access to a Commvault Command Center API endpoint.
	•	Valid Commvault credentials.

Building the Provider Locally

# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/statisticsnorway/terraform-provider-commvaultx.git

# 2. Build the provider binary
go build -o terraform-provider-commvaultx

# 3. Create the local plugin directory
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/statisticsnorway/commvaultx/0.1.0/darwin_arm64

# (Replace darwin_arm64 with linux_amd64 or your platform)
# 4. Move the binary into the plugin directory
mv terraform-provider-commvaultx ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/statisticsnorway/commvaultx/0.1.0/darwin_arm64/

# 5. Make it executable
chmod +x ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/statisticsnorway/commvaultx/0.1.0/darwin_arm64/terraform-provider-commvaultx
